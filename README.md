# Calculator-v1

This is an initial attempt at creating a working calculator in javascript.
I will also attempt to make this interactive in the DOM.

When working with this type of program there are a few things to consider.

1.  Variables.  The numbers being operated on.
2. The Operations being selected.
3. Are there any decimals.
4. Where are these numbers being displayed.

Outside of actually handing the operations/inputs.  How are the results displayed.  Is every exception handled?  Do you even know what all the exceptions could be?
